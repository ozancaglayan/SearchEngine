What is this?
-------------

This is a simple Search Engine written in Python/Qt
which indexes the daily stories of AP newswires of the year 1989.

How can we try?
---------------

You have to checkout the full repository from
http://github.com/ozancaglayan/SearchEngine

and then run the application with the following command:

python build.py -x

Once the application is launched, you first have to create
the indexes and then load them before being able to query the
document base.

NOTE: This is not tested at all on Windows.
